/* Write a function, howOld(), that has two number parameters, age and year, and returns how old someone who is currently that age was (or will be) during that year. Handle three different cases:

If the year is in the future, you should return a string in the following format:
'You will be [calculated age] in the year [year passed in]'

Copy to Clipboard

If the year is before they were born, you should return a string in the following format:
'The year [year passed in] was [calculated number of years] years before you were born'

Copy to Clipboard

If the year is in the past but not before the person was born, you should return a string in the following format:
'You were [calculated age] in the year [year passed in]'
 */


/* 
Our solution is written as a function expression and uses string interpolation, but it would be equally acceptable to use a function declaration and/or string concatenation
*/

const howOld = (age, year) => {
// The following two lines make it so that our function always knows the current year.
    let dateToday = new Date();
    let thisYear = dateToday.getFullYear();
// It is totally ok if your function used the current year directly!
  
    const yearDifference = year - thisYear
    const newAge = age + yearDifference
    if (newAge > age) {
        return `You will be ${newAge} in the year ${year}`
    } else if (newAge < 0) {
        return `The year ${year} was ${-newAge} years before you were born`
    } else {
        return `You were ${newAge} in the year ${year}`
